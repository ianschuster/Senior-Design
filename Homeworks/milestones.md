# Milestones, Timeline, and Effort Matrix

## Milestones
| Milestone | Description | Expected Completion Date |
|--|--|--|
|Collect image data for training AI| This will involve having a full training set for whatever AI framework we decide to utilize. | 10/17/2021 |
|Create an AI that can identify targets| This AI will be able to identify balloons in the view of the camera and output their x/y coordinates. | 11/07/2021|
|Building laser pointer setup 1 week| This will be a 3D printed setup which can hold the laser pointer with a motor. | 11/14/2021|
|Script that can control laser pointer setup| This will be able to take x/y commands and conver them into angular positions for the motor to move the laser pointer. | 11/21/2021|
|Connecting AI, control script, and physical side together| This will be the fully functioning setup that we can demo. |12/11/2021|


## Timeline
|Task| Start |End|
|--|--|--|
|**1.** Research tensorflow and other similar AI libraries to find one that fits our use case| 10/10/2021 | 10/17/2021|
|**2.** Design a high level plan of how AI, camera, and laser pointer setup will interact and adapt as balloons are popped|11/07/2021|11/14/2021|
|**3.** Research and 3D print laser pointer controller|11/07/2021|11/14/2021|
|**4.** Obtain powerful laser pointer|11/07/2021|11/14/2021|
|**5.** Obtain lots of balloons|11/07/2021|11/14/2021|
|**6.** Develop AI tool to acquire balloon targets and output their x/y position|11/21/2021|12/11/2021|
|**7.** Test AI tool extensively to ensure only balloons will be recognized, I.E. make sure people’s heads don’t get marked as targets| 1/10/2022 | 1/16/2021|
|**8.** Investigate using arduino to control laser pointer setup|1/16/2022|1/23/2022|
|**9.** Obtain Raspberry PI or Arduino|1/23/2021|1/30/2022|
|**10.** Develop a script to take x/y position and map to a command for controlling the laser pointer|1/30/2022|2/06/2022|
|**11.** Test controlling laser pointer with hard coded commands to ensure script maps values properly|2/06/2022|2/13/2022|
|**12.** Connect AI and laser pointer setup together and test basic functionality|2/13/2022|2/20/2022|
|**13.** Discover the limits of everything, can it handle moving targets? A room full of balloons?|2/20/2022|2/27/2022|
