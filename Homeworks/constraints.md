## Economic Constraint
This project will rely on a powerful enough laser to pop balloons in timely fashion. These types of lasers tend to be much more expensive than your typical keychain red laser pointer and will be a large portion of our budget. This will likely cost between $100-250. Other costs include 3d printing materials, a motor for controlling aiming of the laser, and lots of balloons.

## Scope Constraint
The scope of this project is not fully set in stone. Once we have a working AI system there will need to be testing of the system in terms of how quickly it can run on our hardware. This will determine things like if the system can handle continuous video feedback which would enable us to target moving balloons. The precision of the system will also determine how specific the targetting can get in terms of recognizing color or symbols on the balloons.

## Safety Constraint
Since we will be using a very powerful laser pointer to pop the balloons, a malfunction such as the program confusing a persons head for a balloon could be harmful. Because of this proper safety equipment and precautions will have to be taken when testing/demoing the project. The system will need an emergency shutoff for the laser as well as extensive training of the AI not to make such a mistake.
