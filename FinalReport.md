### **Project Abstract**

The Auto Laser project will revolve around controlling a laser pointer which moves based on an AI which detects and tracks objects such as balloons. The laser pointer will be powerful enough to pop said balloons, and should be able to take different inputs such as color or shape to determine whether to target the balloon(s) or not.

# User Stories and Design Diagrams

### User Stories

As an end user, I want to be able to select a symbol from a list of symbols so that the artificial intelligence may target the symbol with the laser.

As an end user, I want the artificial intelligence to detect only ***balloons*** that have symbols on them so that random objects do not get burnt.

As an end user, I want to be able to stop the laser at any point (like a kill switch) in the event of an emergency.
