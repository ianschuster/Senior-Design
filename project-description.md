## **Project Topic Area**

Project will revolve around controlling a laser pointer which moves based on an AI which detects and tracks objects such as balloons. Laser pointer will be powerful enough to pop said balloons, and should be able to take different inputs such as color to determine whether to target the balloon(s) or not.

## Final Project Abstract

The AutoLaser utilizes a camera and smart imaging tools to recognize, target, and track balloons with a laser pointer connected to servos. It has a GUI which allows a user to select the color of balloon they want to target, and displays the distance of that balloon from the camera.
