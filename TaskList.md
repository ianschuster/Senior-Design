# Task List


## James

1.  Research tensorflow and other similar AI libraries to find one that fits our use case
    
2.  Research and 3D print laser pointer controller.
    
3.  Obtain powerful laser pointer
    
4.  Obtain lots of balloons
    
5.  Design a high level plan of how AI, camera, and laser pointer setup will interact and adapt as balloons are popped
    
6.  Develop AI tool to acquire balloon targets and output their x/y position
    

  

## Ian

1.  Test AI tool extensively to ensure only balloons will be recognized, I.E. make sure people’s heads don’t get marked as targets.
    
2.  Develop a script to take x/y position and map to a command for controlling the laser pointer.
    
3.  Investigate using arduino to control laser pointer setup
    
4.  Obtain Raspberry PI or Arduino
    
5.  Test controlling laser pointer with hard coded commands to ensure script maps values properly
    
6.  Connect AI and laser pointer setup together and test basic functionality

8.  Discover the limits of everything, can it handle moving targets? A room full of balloons?
