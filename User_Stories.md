## User Stories

As an end user, I want to be able to select a symbol from a list of symbols so that the artificial intelligence may target the symbol with the laser.

As an end user, I want the artificial intelligence to detect only ***balloons*** that have symbols on them so that random objects do not get burnt.

As an end user, I want to be able to stop the laser at any point (like a kill switch) in the event of an emergency.
